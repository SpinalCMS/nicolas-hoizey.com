There have already been [some explorations on responsive SVG images](http://blog.cloudfour.com/media-queries-in-svg-images/) a while back, but when [Joe Harrison](http://www.joeharrison.co.uk/) posted [a responsive icon concept](http://dribbble.com/shots/1290195-New-Project-Responsive-Icons) on Dribbble and even a working version on [a dedicated website](http://responsiveicons.co.uk/), a few people thought this was [so wrong](http://xkcd.com/386/) they had to make their own version. I must admit I'm one of themâ€¦ ðŸ˜‰

[Mariusz Ciesla](http://mariusz.cc/) made [a version](https://codepen.io/mariusz/pen/azBne) with one single div, using one single sprite image:

<p class="codepen" data-height="480" data-theme-id="2148" data-default-tab="result" data-user="nhoizey" data-slug-hash="mRLLzg" data-preview="true" style="height: 480px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Responsive Icons">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/nhoizey/pen/mRLLzg">

  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
<script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

[Justin Avery](http://justinavery.me/), famous for [the Responsive Design Weekly newsletter](http://responsivedesignweekly.com/) made [his own version](http://responsivedesign.is/articles/responsive-icons) also with a single SVG image, but with Media Queries inside the SVG itself:

<p class="codepen" data-height="480" data-theme-id="2148" data-default-tab="result" data-user="nhoizey" data-slug-hash="mRLLzg" data-preview="true" style="height: 480px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Responsive Icons">

  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
<script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

My own attempt tries to really use SVG features, by using sub elements as progressively revealed building blocks, instead of full houses for every breakpoint. The purpose is to remove as much redundancy as possible, and add some semantic on the way.

There have been concerns in the Dribble comments that the original have too much variation for a single icon, that will affect memorability and recognition. I tend to agree and did only improve details without modifying the whole design of the icon at the larger size.

SVG is even inline in the HTML, so there is no additional request at all.

[Here it is](https://codepen.io/nhoizey/pen/ICJvA):

<p class="codepen" data-height="480" data-theme-id="2148" data-default-tab="result" data-user="nhoizey" data-slug-hash="ICJvA" data-preview="true" style="height: 480px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="SVG Responsive Icons">

I made a little screencast for those who don't have SVG support in their browser:

There are still some parts missing:

- maybe more detailed icon for huge sizes;
- a fallback for browsers lacking SVG support.
