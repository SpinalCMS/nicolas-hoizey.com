What Matt writes echoes a lot with some [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) principles, even if he doesn't mention it.

> What, then, is a personal website? It is precisely that, personal. It is a new kind of self-portraiture done not with pencils, charcoal, ink, or paint. Instead it is self-portraiture done in markup language, code, prose, images, audio, and video.

As Matt also says:

> [With the Web,] <mark>one could have as many websites as one did interests</mark>, given sufficient leisure time. Moreover, oneâ€™s interests need not intersect at all if they formed a combination of interests that might have raised judgmental eyebrows in the immediate neighborhood.

I chose to differenciate [my written content here](/) and [my photography creations elsewhere](https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/) because I know some people are not interested in both, and I wanted to present photography very differently.

It reminds me of a great quote I used in [my talk about POSSE and IndieWeb]({% link_to "ne-vous-laissez-plus-deposseder-de-vos-contenus" %}), from [Brad Frost](https://bradfrost.com/)'s [Write on your own website](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/write-on-your-own-website/):

> Writing on your own website associates your thoughts and ideas with you as a person. Having a distinct website design helps strengthen that association.
