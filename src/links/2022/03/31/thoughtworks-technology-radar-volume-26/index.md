In [the Techniques section], there's a ["SPA by default" blip](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques?blipid=202203006) set to "Hold":

> the sheer prevalence of teams choosing a single-page application (SPA) by default when they need a website has us concerned that <mark>people aren't even recognizing SPAs as an architectural style to begin with, instead immediately jumping into framework selection</mark>. SPAs incur complexity that simply doesn't exist with traditional server-based websites

So true. And sad.
