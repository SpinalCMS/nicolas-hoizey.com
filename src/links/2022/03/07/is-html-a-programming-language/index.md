Heydon realeased a new Webbed Briefs episode, always entertaining!

> In this episode, I ask a question that has never been asked before and has **certainly not** in any way caused a great number of arguments and **nobody** has ever been blocked or muted on social media for asking it. Bon appÃ©tit.
