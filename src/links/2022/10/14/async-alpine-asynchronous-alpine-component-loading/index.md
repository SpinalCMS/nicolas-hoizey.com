> Async Alpine is a wrapper for the fantastic [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) JavaScript library, giving you <mark>greater control of component loading and adding asynchronous/lazy loading to Alpine</mark>. This makes loading components when visible, for certain screen widths, on events and more, super simple!
