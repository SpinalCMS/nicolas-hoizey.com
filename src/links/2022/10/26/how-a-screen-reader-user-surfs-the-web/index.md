> In this webinar you’ll learn how and why <mark>semantic HTML helps screen reader users browse your website</mark>, whilst being mostly transparent to people who do not use an Assistive Technology (AT). Join Léonie Watson,  a blind screen reader user, as she explores the web, and find out about some unexpected properties of HTML elements that not only have a huge impact on accessibility, but also turn out to be pretty good for performance too.
