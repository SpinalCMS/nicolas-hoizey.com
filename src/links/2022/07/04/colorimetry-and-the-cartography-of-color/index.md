> A good comparison for interpolation and color spaces is that of cartography and illustrating flight paths. Here we can think of color spaces as being different maps. Interpolations and color steps are essentially the plotting a flight path from one location to another.

> Depending on the type of map (color space) you’re looking at, the path may look very different — so much, in fact, that you may see artificial patterns or misinterpret these patterns when compared to human perception of color.
