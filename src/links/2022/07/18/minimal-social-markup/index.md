There's unfortunately a lot to know when you want to provide social networks/apps with personnalized informations (title, description, image), while most of it has already been in our HTML for decades… 🤷‍♂️

> I also believe this markup is still too much—in short, Twitter should follow Open Graph (including dumping `twitter:card`), and all social markup consumers should respect document titles (Twitter doesn’t) and meta descriptions.

So let's not pollute our HTML too much.
