Manuel's ban from Twitter should be a lesson for us all:

> If there’s something I’ve learned from this whole thing, it’s that I must be more careful with how and where I share my content. <mark>A social media platform should not be the primary source</mark>. I’ve often advised small business owners to not just use their Facebook profile as their website, for obvious reasons. I, you probably as well, should also take my advice and do the same for my online presence. <mark>Create everything on my own website and syndicate elsewhere, because you never know what might happen to your content or profile tomorrow</mark>.
