> At one point in time Spectrum had <mark>210,180 design tokens in an 18MB JSON file</mark>. We had to reinvent “design tokens” in a way that could accommodate for the high degree of specificity (security, flexibility, automation) without all the bloat of a traditional design token output type. This meant more innovation, but also came with an amplified learning curve. Ultimately this negatively impacted our ability to grow contributions into the token system.

Wow! 🤯

Interesting presentation of strengths and weaknesses of component level design tokens, just when I have to decide if we put some in a Design System I currently help build… 🤔
