> So, your Twitter archive is far from being a safe, independent backup in case you want to delete your account or if Twitter ever dies completely.

I would have used a more alarming title, as JSON to Markdown conversion doesn't look like the main issue. At least you have the content in JSON. Restoring actual URLs from `t.co` ones and original images looks like a higher priority.

Thanks Matthias for sharing a solution!
