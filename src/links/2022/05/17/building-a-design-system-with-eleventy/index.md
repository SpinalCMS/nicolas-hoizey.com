Trys shows here some of the power of Eleventy, the best static site generator, to generate a Design System with components.

> Eleventy was the obvious candidate. Generating “pages from data” was the most compelling feature, and add to that the flexibility in templating and the rapid build times, <mark>there really was no other stack that came close</mark>.

The result on [the Malvern Panalytical design system](https://brand.malvernpanalytical.com/) is really great!

It also uses Zach's [Seven Minutes Tabs web component](https://github.com/zachleat/seven-minute-tabs) and Trys' (and James') own [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) for the fluid responsive typographic and spacing scales. 😍

I now have to try it for my own Eleventy powered sites!
