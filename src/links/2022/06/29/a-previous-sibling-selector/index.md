This is really clever, I hope we'll get support for `:has()` everywhere soon!

> I can remember a time when it was difficult to find selectors that would target all your use cases. But now-a-days, with the powerful new selectors we’re getting in CSS like `:where()`, `:is()`, `:not()`, and `:has()`, I rarely need to target something for which I cannot find a selector. It’s amazing!
