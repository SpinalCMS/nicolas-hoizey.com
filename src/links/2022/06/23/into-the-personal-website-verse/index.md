I can't believe I didn't share this great article sooner, when Matthias published it 3 years ago (already!).

As he says, I should have done it:

> Whenever you stumble upon an interesting thought on another site, write about it and link to it. Not only is it respectful to link to the person you quoted, but hyperlinks are also the magic force holding the Web together. They are both helpful and powerful. You can also add a links section to your site, where you collect interesting links you found on the web and over time build an archive for yourself and others.

It resonates so much with my own [article and talk about owning your own site, and use social networks only as echo chambers](/archives/?type=articles&type=talks&tags=POSSE) (aka [POSSE]({% link_to "tags/posse" %})).
