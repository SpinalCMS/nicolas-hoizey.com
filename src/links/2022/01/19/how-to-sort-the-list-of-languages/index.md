When asked about how to sort languages for the W3C site redesign, Richard made a great detailed answer, with a nice focus on user needs:

> Sorting by most-often-used language is mostly basing the decision on our view of the world, rather than the user's needs.
> The issue at hand is rather how to help the individual user locate their language as painlessly as possible, and with the minimal amount of implied bias.
> I don't think it should be an exercise in classification. We should look for a way of ordering items that implies no bias, and is predictable.
