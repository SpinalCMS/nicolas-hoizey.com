Yeees! ðŸ¥³

Butâ€¦ there's a big "but" in Jeremy's article, and I agree, we need ambiant badging in the browser UI, and/or a way to launch the install prompt from our own page UI.

I don't really like how [beforeinstallprompt](https://web.dev/learn/pwa/installation-prompt/#the-beforeinstallprompt-event) works, but we don't have better yet.
