> The venerable [Time To Interactive (TTI)](https://web.dev/tti/) metric is being removed in Lighthouse 10, with its 10% score weight shifted to [Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)](https://web.dev/cls/), which will now account for 25% of the [overall performance score](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring/#lighthouse-10). Ideally this change will increase focus on CLS for sites that still need fixes for unnecessary layout shifts.

Soooo… most sites will have an increased Lighthouse score, without any real improvement. I have mixed feelings…
