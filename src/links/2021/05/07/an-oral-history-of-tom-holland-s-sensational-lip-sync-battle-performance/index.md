Today I learned [there is a "Tom Holland Umbrella Law"](https://news.avclub.com/it-s-tom-holland-umbrella-o-clock-somewhere-1845588216): "Once you watch it, you must share". So I do.

I watched this several times over the years, and I still enjoy it a lot!

This "oral history" adds even more to the legend, well presented by Ashley Spencer:

> And then came Tom Holland's "Lip Sync Battle" mashup of Gene Kelly and Rihanna, or what is <mark>essentially two minutes and 10 seconds of perfection in every sense of the word</mark>. Ditching his initial top hat and suit to grind on a literal umbrella and perform a sensual routine in a pleather leotard, red lipstick, and chin-length wig, the British actor, then 20, obliterated gender constructs and defied the expectations of how a newly minted action star should market himself.
