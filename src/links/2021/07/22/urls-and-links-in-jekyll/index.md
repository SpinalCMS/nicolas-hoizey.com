I'm not using Jekyll anymore, but I would have liked to find such a detailed documentation when I did start using it, years ago.

One particular need I always have when building sites is to "organize supporting assets with a post in the same directory", as Michael shows in the [Document-relative URLs](https://mademistakes.com/mastering-jekyll/how-to-link/#document-relative-urls) section, where he cites [jekyll-postfiles](https://nhoizey.github.io/jekyll-postfiles/), the Jekyll plugin I developed to provide a solution to this missing feature.
