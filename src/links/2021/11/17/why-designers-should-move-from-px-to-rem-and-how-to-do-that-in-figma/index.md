If you're a Web developer (as most of my readers), you already know that [users DO change font size]({% link_to "users-do-change-font-size" %}) (in their browser preferences), so you make sure to use proportional dimension units (`em`, `rem`, `%`, etc.) instead of `px` everywhere you can.

Christine shows how UI designers can (should) also work with proportional dimension units in mind when designing in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), which unfortunately only supports `px` currently:

> why should you still bother about relative units as a UX/UI Designer? **Because you are a nice person and <mark>would not park in the disabled parking, just because it’s more convenient</mark>** (at least I hope you don’t). If you want another reason, **you are legally required to make your website accessible**
