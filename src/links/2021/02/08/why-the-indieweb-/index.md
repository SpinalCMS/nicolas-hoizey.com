Heydon is back with a new brilliant [Webbed Briefs](https://briefs.video/) video, this time about the rise and fall of the free Web, and the new hope that is [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/).

> This is the story of the birth of the web, its loss of innocence, its decline, and what we can do to make it a bit less gross. Or if you prefer, this is the video in which I say the expression “barbecue sets” far too many times.

If you understand French, I talked a little more — but with much less fun — [about the IndieWeb in 2019]({% link_to "ne-vous-laissez-plus-deposseder-de-vos-contenus" %}), during the Paris Web conference, where Heydon also gave a great talk.

If you want to dive into IndieWeb, there are [IndieWeb Events](https://events.indieweb.org/) you can attend!
