Jake continues his series of web performance audits, this time with the site for Google's I/O conference, and the result is a real shame.

> Imagine you went to a restaurant, took a seat, and 20 minutes later you still haven't been given a menu. You ask where it is, and you're told "oh, we're currently cooking you everything you might possibly ask for. *Then* we'll give you the menu, you'll pick something, and <mark>we'll be able to give you it instantly, because it'll all be ready</mark>". This sounds like a silly way to do things, but it's the strategy the I/O site is using.

I really hope there are very good excuses for this mess.
