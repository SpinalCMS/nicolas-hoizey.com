Here's a good introduction to the Fediverse from Paula, with details about Mastodon and Pixelfed.

> Imagine Twitter, Facebook, Instagram & Co were all part of one giant network. That's basically what the fediverse is, except the parts are less well known, <mark>free & decentralized alternatives to those</mark>.
>
> E.g. Mastodon is like Twitter, Friendica is like Facebook, Pixelfed is like Instagram and there are many more.
>
> If you e.g. have a Mastodon account you can follow accounts on Friendica or Pixelfed and you might not even notice, that they are not Mastodon accounts.
