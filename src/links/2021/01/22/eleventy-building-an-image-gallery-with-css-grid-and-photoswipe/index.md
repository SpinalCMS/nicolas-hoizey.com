Mark is using my [Images Responsiver plugin for Eleventy](https://nhoizey.github.io/images-responsiver/eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver/) with [Netlify Large Media](https://www.netlify.com/products/large-media/) and [PhotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com/) to build an image gallery, and it's really great!
