I agree with Zach that the Lighthouse scores we see - shared mostly on Twitter - should be taken with a grain of salt, as they are often shared without any mention of the test conditions.

Even using Page Speed Insight - a tool that many of our less technical clients rely on heavily - should be done with caution, as scores for the same page can vary by as much as 15 points in a matter of minutes.
