> To add a description to an image, author a string inside of [an `alt` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attr-alt) declared on an `img` element. Assistive technology will recognize the presence of the `alt` attribute and read the string as it moves through the page or view.
>
> In addition to making sure your alt description is accurate, thereâ€™s one other thing you can do that makes for a good experience: <mark>ending your alt text string with punctuation</mark>.
