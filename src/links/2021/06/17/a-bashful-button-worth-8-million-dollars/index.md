6 years ago I reported [a bug about 100vh being larger than the viewport height in Safari]({% link_to "viewport-height-is-taller-than-the-visible-part-of-the-document-in-some-mobile-browsers" %}). It was "intentional" according to webkit/Safari team, and other browsers followed… 🤦‍♂️

Now Jason shows here how this "tiny little annoyance"[^visits] may have **cost $8.1 million a year to one single brand**.

[^visits]: I still get at least 1000 visits a month on this article!

Imagine the total for all sites of other brands… 💸💸💸

As Jason says:

And [he knows this more than anyone else](https://cloudfour.com/portland-device-lab/).
