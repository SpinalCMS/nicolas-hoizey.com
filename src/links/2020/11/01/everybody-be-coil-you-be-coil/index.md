I've been using Web Monetization and Coil for [a little more than one year](https://github.com/nhoizey/nicolas-hoizey.com/commit/9ad8223c20f4371e97c8c044546cc0de5ead4ae1) now, and I couldn't agree more with Léonie:

> I am under no illusion that writing will ever be a major source of income, in fact if I ever receive enough to cover my own monthly subscription to Coil I'll be a happy person. But I do think that Coil and Web Monetization are <mark>at the vanguard of a quiet revolution</mark>.
