A great talk from Stéphanie about responsible use of responsive components:

> In the talk, I show how I design systems of components that **go beyond responsive adaptation to different screen/viewport size** and can also be used in different **layout** and **container contexts**. I also try to make sure that my components work <mark>**beyond the perfect “happy path perfect situation”**</mark>: what happens with super long text, missing images/content for example? And how about adapting components to user needs across specific points in their journey and build **truly adaptive systems**?

Stéphanie shares the slides, a video recording AND the transcript. 👍
