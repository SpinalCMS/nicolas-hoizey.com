> Let’s not get too hung up about the past and how much great and good we did back then. And <mark>let’s fight that first urge to be snarky and feel a “oh god, not again” in our heads</mark> as that is our baggage and not the one of the web community. We’ve dropped the ball somewhere along the line talking exclusively to a receptive audience instead of moving on with our advocacy into academia, enterprise and education.

I have to admit it sometimes happens to me, unfortunately. I'll keep this in my mind for next time.
