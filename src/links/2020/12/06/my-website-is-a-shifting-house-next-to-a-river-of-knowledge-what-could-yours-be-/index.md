> Although they may seem initially accommodating and convenient to their users, universally popular social media sites—like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Pinterest—<mark>are private companies that prioritize advertising above their users’ needs</mark>. Their users’ happiness is not the primary focus, so it’s perfectly normal for you to feel anxiety when using or even thinking about social media. In this age of digital cacophony dominated by these platforms, no one is looking out for you… but you. It makes perfect sense, then, when <mark>individuals tell me they want their website to do the job of “setting the record straight” on who they are and what they do</mark>.

This reminds me a lot about [IndieWeb](/tags/indieweb/), which Laurel never mentions.

> A website can be anything. It doesn’t (and probably shouldn’t) be an archive of your complete works. That’s going to be dead the moment you publish. A website, or anything interactive, is inherently unfinished. It’s imperfect—maybe sometimes it even has a few bugs. But <mark>that’s the beauty of it. Websites are living, temporal spaces</mark>.
