Here is a great new open source tool provided by the Cloud Four team! 👍

> Lighthouse Parade is a Node.js command line tool that crawls a domain and gathers lighthouse performance data for every page. With a single command, the tool will crawl an entire site, run a Lighthouse report for each page, and then output a spreadsheet with the aggregated data.

I will however welcome [an option to limit the crawling](https://github.com/cloudfour/lighthouse-parade/issues/52), because I already have more than 2300 pages on my personal site, and many more on most clients sites… 😅
