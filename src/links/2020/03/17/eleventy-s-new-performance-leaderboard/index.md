> Eleventy doesn’t do any special optimizations out of the box to make your sites fast. It doesn’t protect you from making a slow site. But importantly <mark>it also doesn’t add anything extra either</mark>. This sort of developer empowerment over the final product has seemed to attract an amazing group of performance oriented developers using the project and I am so grateful to every one of you.
