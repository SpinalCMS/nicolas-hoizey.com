Following [Adobe announcing the end of development for PhoneGap and PhoneGap Build](/links/2020/08/12/update-for-customers-using-phonegap-and-phonegap-build/), Maximiliano Firtman looks at what PhoneGap provided, and what it really means for current needs.

> I think Adobe's statement is not entirely true; we are not 100% ready to remove app containers for all the web apps. We are closer today than 12 years ago, for sure. We are closer than 2 years ago. But Apache Cordova will still be there as well as Capacitor if your web app can't use just the PWA technologies.
