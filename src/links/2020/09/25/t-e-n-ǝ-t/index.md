I really enjoyed [Tenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenet_(film)), Christopher Nolan's new action packed movie! I already saw it twice, and would definitely enjoy a third time.

If you already saw it or don't mind the spoilers, I really invite you to read Jeremy's great review, full of interesting ideas about time travel in general and in movies. I now have to see [Primer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(film)).
