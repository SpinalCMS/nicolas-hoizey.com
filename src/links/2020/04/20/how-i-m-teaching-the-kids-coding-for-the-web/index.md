I love how Remy progressively explained HTML tags and CSS selectors to his children:

> I loaded up a browser and explained that "this is a web page". It's like a person in some ways. <mark>The bones are the HTML. Each bone has a name, we call them tags (or elements)</mark>. Each bone does it's own special thing, like the `<p>` tag/bone will show some text.
