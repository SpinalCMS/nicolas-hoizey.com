I guess you were already using the [Machete Order](https://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2011/11/11/the-star-wars-saga-suggested-viewing-order/) to watch the first two Star Wars trilogies, like anyone serious about it. 😅

Now that there are eleven (11!)[^solo] Star Wars movies[^ewoks], we needed a new Machete Order, and I must say i like Jeremy's suggestion[^spoil]! 👍

[^solo]: I'm not a big fan of Solo, at all, and I could remove it altogether without disturbing the new Machete Order, but I've already said too much[^footnotes].

[^ewoks]: I could add both Ewoks movies, for younger ones, through.

[^spoil]: I won't spoil you here, read Jeremy's post to follow the reasoning.

[^footnotes]: By the way, do you read footnotes while you encounter the link in the main text, or all at the end… or not a all? 🤔
