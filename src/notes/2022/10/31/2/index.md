Would it be useful to add a filter on linked authors to my [links page](https://nicolas-hoizey.com/links/)?

For example, the most linked author is currently @zachleat 😁
https://nicolas-hoizey.com/links/?query=Zach%2520Leatherman

![I already shared 6 links to Zach Leatherman's contents](links-search-zach-leatherman.jpg)
