I don't understand why #Dareboost reports that "7 resources has a non-consistent extension with its actual content"[^plural] in [this report](https://www.dareboost.com/en/report/28332/a_4628b27696b2ef918a15d939d) where #Cloudinary images were proxified through #Netlify and #Cloudflare, but not on [this other report](https://www.dareboost.com/en/report/28332/a_4628c78e96b2ef918a1606f88) where they come directly from Cloudinary… 🤷‍♂️

[^plural]: By the way, there's an issue with pluralization… 😅
