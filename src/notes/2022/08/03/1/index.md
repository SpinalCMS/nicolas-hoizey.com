To have different #Cloudflare Pages preview builds, I discovered [the `if-env` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/if-env) and [the `CF_PAGES_BRANCH` variable](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/build-configuration/#environment-variables):

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "if-env CF_PAGES_BRANCH=main && npm run main || npm run preview"
  }
}
```

Awkward syntax thoughâ€¦
