It's pretty annoying to see the same toot repeatedly on #Mastodon because everyone is boosting it, even if it's legitimately awesome.

Currently, a boost of a toot is only posted if at least 40 other toots have been posted since the previous boost of the same toot.

There is a GitHub issue asking to allow the user to change this number, or set a duration instead:
