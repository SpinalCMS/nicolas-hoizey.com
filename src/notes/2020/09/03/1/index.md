I wonder if I should use a Git monorepo for both [images-responsiver](https://github.com/nhoizey/images-responsiver/) and [eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver](https://github.com/nhoizey/eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver/), the #Eleventy wrapper. 🤔

It might be better to manage dependencies, sync npm releases, and make it easier for users to find/add issues.

Any recommendation welcome on [this issue](https://github.com/nhoizey/eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver/issues/52). 🙏
