Should I use a monorepo for [images-responsiver](https://github.com/nhoizey/images-responsiver/) and [eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver](https://github.com/nhoizey/eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver/), the #Eleventy plugin? ğŸ¤”

Might be better to manage dependencies and sync releases, and easier for users to find/add issues.
