Homebrew removed the cask for [Subsmarine](https://www.cocoawithchurros.com/subsmarine.php) because there were ["too few downloads"](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/commit/19ad2b9e10417f95ccab12ee8031e2bea96ec13e)â€¦ ðŸ˜¥

I'm glad I could create [my own tap](https://github.com/nhoizey/homebrew-cask)!

Feel free to use it: `brew tap nhoizey/cask`
