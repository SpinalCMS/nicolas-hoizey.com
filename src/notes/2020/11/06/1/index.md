Do anyone know why Google made it mandatory for #PWA icons to be PNG, not JPEG or other?

This is what #Lighthouse [requires](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/master/lighthouse-core/lib/icons.js#L36-L45), but I couldn't find any docs about this. #MDN says [other formats are fine](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Add_to_home_screen#Appropriate_icon).
