@bagder hi Daniel, reading https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2016/08/18/http2-connection-coalescing/ (yes, I'm late ðŸ˜…)

If DNS B.example.com returns `192.168.0.2` and `192.168.0.3`, is TLS really enough to be sure it also works on `192.168.0.1`?

BTW, there's a typo near the end: "both IPv4 and IPv4 addresses".
