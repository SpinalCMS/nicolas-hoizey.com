Once again, I'm browsing #Eleventy docs to find which data are available [in a page](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-eleventy-supplied/) and [in a collection item](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/#collection-item-data-structure), and I wish it was the same.

Using Nunjucks macros would be much easier, with a single `item` object holding always the same attributes.

`page.title` vs `item.data.title` for exampleâ€¦
