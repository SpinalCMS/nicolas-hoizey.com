I **HATE** that PWA installed on macOS are so tied to the browser app launch and shut down!

Relevant bugs to star to rise priority:
- [1205537: when opening PWA a Chrome window is also opened](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1205537)
- [940248: Installed PWA should remain running when Chrome is quit](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=940248)
