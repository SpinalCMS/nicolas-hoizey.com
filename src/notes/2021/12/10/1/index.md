Great news, #VSCode now highlights "all uncommon invisible characters in source code"! ðŸŽ‰

This means [the Gremlins extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nhoizey.gremlins) [should remove these characters](https://github.com/nhoizey/vscode-gremlins/issues/225), but I think it is still useful for some others.
