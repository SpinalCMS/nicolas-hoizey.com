[Chris Harrelson](@chrishtr@mastodon.social) in [a new message in this old thread about SMIL deprecation in Chromium](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/5o0yiO440LM/m/qMB_OX84AgAJ):

> SMIL was not deprecated and there are no plans to do so. It's still a supported feature in Chromium.
