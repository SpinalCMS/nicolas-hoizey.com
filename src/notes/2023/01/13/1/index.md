For language changes inside a paragraph, MDN suggests we can use the `i` element:
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/i>

That's what I thought was one of the new use cases for `i`.

A @w3c@w3c.social page about “Declaring language in HTML” (so @webi18n@w3c.social ?) says we should use a `span`, `div` or `bdi`:
<https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-html-language-declarations.en#usingspan>

So no `i` after all?
