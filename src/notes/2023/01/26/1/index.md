TIL `IntersectionObserver`'s `rootMargin` only works if the observer is run in the same-origin-domain, [because of privacy concerns](https://w3c.github.io/IntersectionObserver/#privacy):

> There is a risk that the API may be used to probe for information about the geometry of the global viewport itself, which may be used to deduce the userâ€™s hardware configuration. The motivation for disabling the effects of [`rootMargin`](https://w3c.github.io/IntersectionObserver/#dom-intersectionobserver-rootmargin) and suppressing [`rootBounds`](https://w3c.github.io/IntersectionObserver/#dom-intersectionobserverentry-rootbounds) for [cross-origin-domain targets](https://w3c.github.io/IntersectionObserver/#intersectionobserver-cross-origin-domain-target) is to prevent such probing.

That why this demo of a sticky navigation with highlighted current section doesn't work in CodePen's default viewâ€¦ ðŸ˜ž
