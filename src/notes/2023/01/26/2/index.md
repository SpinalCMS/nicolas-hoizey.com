I updated the footer on <https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/> with nice icons for the other platforms where I publish photos, and the services I use to build and deploy the site.

![Other platforms where I publish photos: Flickr, Unsplash, Mastodon, pixelfed, Locationscout](photo-platforms.png)

![Services I use to build and deploy the site: Eleventy, Cloudinary, Netlify, Cloudflare](site-building-and-hosting-services.png)

Some where hard to find, most were not optimized (thanks [SGVOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/)!).

The Pixelfed one is reaaaaaly heavy with all these gradients, masks and paths.
