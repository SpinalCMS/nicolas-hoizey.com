I'm a bit confused about using IndieAuth with multiple domains.

The documentation is here: <https://indielogin.com/setup#multiple-domains>

> If you have multiple domains, or want your Twitter URL to link to something that is not your main website, you can alternatively put one or more URLs in your "bio" field on Twitter and GitHub. This allows you to use one Twitter account to authenticate multiple domains.

GitHub is mentioned only for the bio part, and it looks like it doesn't work indeed if I only have a link to GitHub on my second domain.

But I don't want to use Twitter anymoreâ€¦ ðŸ˜ž
