A bit confused about IndieAuth with multiple domains: <https://indielogin.com/setup#multiple-domains>

> If you have multiple domains, or want your Twitter URL to link to something that is not your main website, you can alternatively <mark>put one or more URLs in your "bio" field on</mark> Twitter and <mark>GitHub</mark>. This allows you to use one Twitter account to authenticate multiple domains.

GitHub is mentioned for the bio part only, and it looks like it doesn't work if I only have a link to GitHub on my second domain:

![A warning message on indielogin.com that says "Your GitHub profile linked to https://nicolas-hoizey.com/ but we were expecting to see https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/. Make sure you link to https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/ in your GitHub profile"](indielogin-warning-message.png)

I don't want to use Twitter anymoreâ€¦ ðŸ˜ž
