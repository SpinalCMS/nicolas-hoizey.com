I saw [Chris Coyier](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier/) mention [in a tweet](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier/status/1375182445373493249) that there was an issue with code screenshots rendering in Safari, probably because of an [issue with the responsive image code](https://github.com/chriscoyier/coding-fonts/issues/94)[^respimg].

I guess code code screenshots you would use `pixelated`, if you planned to enlarge images, but as @eeeps said, it was a bug in `sizes`.

But there are [4 values supported by different browsers](https://caniuse.com/?search=css%20image-rendering): `pixelated`, `
