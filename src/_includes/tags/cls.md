Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is one of Google's [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/learn-web-vitals/), focused on unexpected movement of page content, annoying for users.

> A layout shift occurs any time a visible element changes its position from one rendered frame to the next. [â€¦] Unexpected movement of page content usually happens because resources are loaded asynchronously or DOM elements get dynamically added to the page above existing content.
