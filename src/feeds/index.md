You can follow my publications with different feeds:

- [latest articles](/feeds/articles.xml), about once a month
- [latest links](/feeds/links.xml), multiple times each week
- [latest notes](/feeds/notes.xml), multiple times each week
- [les derniers billets en fran√ßais](/feeds/billets.xml), plusieurs fois par semaine
- [latest contents from all types](/feeds/all.xml), the most verbose

::: info
If you wonder what "feeds" are, go read [About Feeds](https://aboutfeeds.com/) to understand how they allow you "to subscribe to websites and get the latest content in one place".

You can also follow me [on Mastodon](https://mamot.fr/@nhoizey) or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nhoizey), where the same contents are also pushed.

Most content I create is first published on my own website and then pushed to other platforms for increased audience (aka POSSE).

Your can watch [my talk about IndieWeb and POSSE]({% link_to "ne-vous-laissez-plus-deposseder-de-vos-contenus" %}){href-lang="fr"} (in French) or read [my article about Medium and POSSE]({% link_to "medium-is-only-an-edge-server-of-your-posse-cdn-your-own-blog-is-the-origin" %}).
