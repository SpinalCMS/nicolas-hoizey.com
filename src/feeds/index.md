You can follow my publications with several feeds[^feeds].

[^feeds]: If you wonder what "feeds" are, go read [About Feeds](https://aboutfeeds.com/) to understand how they allow you "to subscribe to websites and get the latest content in one place".

Here are the feeds:

- [latest articles](/feeds/articles.xml), about once a month
- [latest links](/feeds/links.xml), multiple times each week
- [latest notes](/feeds/notes.xml), multiple times each week
- [latest contents from all types](/feeds/all.xml), the most verbose

You can also follow me [on Mastodon](https://mamot.fr/@nhoizey) or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nhoizey).
