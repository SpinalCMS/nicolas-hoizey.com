> Distractions have always been a natural constituent of our lives. But with the rise of mobile technology, a circus of notifications, and all the noise going on around us, **it’s become harder and harder to focus on a task at hand**.
>
> On the web, we are confronted with an unprecedented amount of distractions that gave birth to various tools like Readability, Instapaper, Adblocker, etc. Attention span shortens while the quality of reading experiences declines; ultimately leaving a lot of great content out there undiscovered, unloved, unshared and unread by most.
>
> This is not how we imagined the web to be.
>
> **It’s our job as designers to bring clarity back to the digital canvas** by crafting reading experiences that put readers first.
